\begin{mdframed}[style=darkAnswer,frametitle={Joe Starr}]
  Let $g\circ f$ be injective, but $f$ not injective. Since $f$ is not injective
  $\exists a,x\in A$ such tha $a\neq x$ but $\fof{x}=\fof{a}$. We consider
  $g\circ f\lrp{a}$ and $g\circ f\lrp{x}$, since $\fof{x}=\fof{a}$ it must be that
  $\gof{\fof{x}}=\gof{\fof{a}}$. This means that with $a\neq b$,
  $\gof{\fof{x}}=\gof{\fof{a}}$, making $g\circ f$ not injective a contradiction
  so $f$ injective.

  Let $g\circ f$ be surjective, but $g$ not surjective. Since $g$ not surjective
  there exists some $c\in C$ such that $\gof{b}\neq c$ for all $b\in B$. However
  since $g\circ f$ surjective there exists $g\circ f\lrp{a}=c$ a contradiction,
  making $g$ surjective.
