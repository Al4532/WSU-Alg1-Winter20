1.    Let $m,n.r.s\in \Z$. If $m^2+n^2=r^2+s^2=mr+ns$, prove that $m=r$ and 
$n=r$.

We select $m,n.r.s\in \Z$, given $m^2+n^2=r^2+s^2=mr+ns$ which can write
as $m^2+n^2-mr-ns=r^2+s^2-mr-ns$. From here we can simplify:
\begin{align*}
m^2+n^2-mr-ns=r^2+s^2-mr-ns &\Rightarrow 
m\lrp{m-r}+n\lrp{n-s}=r\lrp{r-m}+s\lrp{s-n} \\
&\Rightarrow m\lrp{m-r}+n\lrp{n-s}-r\lrp{r-m}-s\lrp{s-n}=0 \\
&\Rightarrow m\lrp{m-r}+r\lrp{m-r}+n\lrp{n-s}+s\lrp{n-s}=0 \\
&\Rightarrow \lrp{m-r}\lrp{m+r}+\lrp{n-s}\lrp{n+s}=0 \\
\end{align*}
from here we can see that in order for $\lrp{m-r}\lrp{m+r}+\lrp{n-s}\lrp{n+s}=0$
to be true $m=r$ and $n=s$
